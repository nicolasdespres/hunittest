|hunittest| is a user friendly command line interface for unittest_.
It is to unittest what htop is to top. Just a nicer command line interface.
It does not add or change anything of unittest_ module API.

Features
========

* Work with any unittest test suite
* One line progress status output (inspired by ninja_). Thus, buffering of stdout/stderr
  is always on (no ``-b/--buffer`` option like in usual unittest_ driver).
* No mandatory dependencies.
* Fancy color if your terminal support it.
* Convenient shell completion if you install argcomplete_.
* Error are printed on the go (no need for ``-c/--catch`` equivalent).
* ``-f/--failfast`` option like in unittest_.
* ``-q/--quiet`` option that truly prints nothing. Only the exit status
  tells you whether the test suite was successful.
* ``-t/--top-level-directory`` option just like unittest_.
* Filter rules system.
* Time individual tests
* ImportError are properly reported while collecting test spec.
* Coverage support if you install coverage_.
* |hunittest| write a log of all error/failures (in ``.hunittest/log``)
  so that we can review them using the pager of your choice. By
  default, it will always popup the pager if the error log file is not
  empty. You can control this behavior using the ``--pager`` option.
* Support ``--pdb`` option to start debugging when the first error
  happens.
* Run test whose last status was error or failure first.
* Highlight parts of the traceback concerning user's modules.
* Tested with Python 3.4.x

Installation
============

It requires Python 3.4.x at the moment. And you can install colorama_ and
argcomplete_ (using ``pip3``) if you really want to enjoy it all.

From source
-----------

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone <FIXME:hunittesturl>
    $ cd hunittest
    $ python3 setup.py develop

shell completion
----------------

To enable shell completion follow instructions in argcomplete_ documentation.

Here is just what I did for ``zsh``:

#. Install argcomplete_: ``pip3 install argcomplete``
#. Add something like this to my ``.zshrc``:

    .. code:: bash

        # Register python completion
        if type register-python-argcomplete &> /dev/null
        then
          eval "$(register-python-argcomplete 'hunittest')"
        fi

#. Re-launch your shell: ``exec zsh``

Usage examples
==============

Once installed you can use |hunittest| either like a regular command or like
regular python module.

.. code:: bash

    $ hunittest myproject.test
    $ python3 -m hunittest.cli myproject.test

Note that when using the later form, the shell completion won't work but you
can specify the specific interpreter you want to use.

Known bugs
==========

* Does not work with nested TestCase.
* If shell-completion does not work whereas you have configured it
  well, you probably have a module that cannot be imported. I do not
  know how to print error message in this case using
  argcomplete. Thus, to trouble shoot such situation do:
  ``hunittest -c myproject.test`` to check for any error.
